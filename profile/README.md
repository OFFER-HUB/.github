# OFFER-HUB

OFFER-HUB is an open-source, decentralized freelance marketplace built on the Stellar ecosystem.

The project is designed to enable direct collaboration between freelancers and clients without centralized intermediaries, using blockchain technology to enforce trust, transparency, and fair payments.

---

## Overview

OFFER-HUB provides a decentralized infrastructure where work agreements, payments, and reputation are handled through a combination of on-chain smart contracts and off-chain services.

The platform focuses on real-world usability while preserving the core principles of decentralization and open-source development.

## Core Objectives

The main objectives of OFFER-HUB are:

- Reduce reliance on centralized freelance platforms
- Enable trust-minimized work agreements
- Protect both freelancers and clients through escrow mechanisms
- Provide transparent and verifiable reputation systems
- Support fast, low-cost, global payments

---

## Architecture Approach

OFFER-HUB follows a hybrid architecture:

- On-chain components handle escrow, disputes, and reputation logic
- Off-chain services manage indexing, APIs, and user-facing applications
- Wallet-based authentication replaces traditional account systems

This approach ensures scalability without compromising decentralization.

## Open Source & Community

OFFER-HUB is developed as a fully open-source project.

All core components are maintained in public repositories and evolve through community contributions, discussions, and reviews. Transparency and auditability are first-class principles of the project.

The project aligns with the open-source values promoted by the **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}** and the broader Stellar ecosystem.
